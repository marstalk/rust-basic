/**
 * by default, the borrowing rules is applied in the compiling time:
 * 1. At any given time, you can have either (but not both) one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
 * 2. References must always be valid.
 *
 * but with the help of RefCell, we can enforce the borrowing rules in the runtime.
 *
 * For those reasons, checking the borrowing rules at compile time is the best choice in the majority of cases,
 * which is why this is Rustâ€™s default.
